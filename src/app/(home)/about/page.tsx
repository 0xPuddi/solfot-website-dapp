              The Premier League is the organising body of the Premier League

              However, we do not operate in isolation. We work proactively and
              constructively with our Member Clubs and the other football

              and across the world.

                The Premier League is a private company wholly owned by its 20
                Member Clubs who make up the League at any one time.
              </span>
              <span>
                Each individual club is independent, working within the rules of
                football, as defined by the Premier League, The FA, UEFA and
                FIFA, as well as being subject to English and European law.
              </span>
              <span>
                Each of the 20 clubs are a Shareholder in the Premier League.
                Consultation is at the heart of the Premier League and
                Shareholder meetings are the ultimate decision-making forum for
                Premier League policy and are held at regular intervals during
                the course of the season.
              </span>
              <span>
                The Premier League AGM takes place at the close of each season,
                at which time the relegated clubs transfer their shares to the
                clubs promoted into the Premier League from the Football League
                Championship.
              </span>
              <span>
                Clubs have the opportunity to propose new rules or amendments at
                the Shareholder meeting. Each Member Club is entitled to one
                vote and all rule changes and major commercial contracts require
                the support of at least a two-thirds vote, or 14 clubs, to be
                agreed.
              </span>
              <span>
                The Premier League Rule Book, contained within the Handbook
                (Download: Premier League Handbook; PDF 18.2MB), serves as a
                contract between the League, the Member Clubs and one another,
                defining the structure and running of the competition.
              </span>
              <span>
                Any serious breach of the Rule Book results in an independent
                three-person tribunal sitting to hear the case, ascertain guilt
                and set the punishment, which can range from fines to points
                deductions and, in extreme cases, expulsion from the competition
                (this has never happened in the history of the Premier League).
              </span>
              <span>
                At the Premier League's AGM in June 2022, an Owners' Charter was
                agreed by Clubs. The Owners and Directors of the Member Clubs
                are custodians of those organisations and will uphold the spirit
                of the Charter's commitments.
